The program strive to demonstrate various aspects of java programming.

* User interaction and input
* File manipulation
* Logging

The program can read input form the user, list files in a resource folder and find files by their extension.
Besides that the program can read a text file, find the size of it, count the amount of lines in it, search for and count occurences of specific words in the file.
